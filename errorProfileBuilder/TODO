-Generate staircase effect profile or model it using a gaussian distribution?

-For the homopolymers, this is the algorithm we have in mind:
	-Keep in memory the n last bases when we write a read
		-if these bases are all a A or all a C and so on, with a certain probability p I insert m additionnal bases of the same nucleotide (homopolymer insertion) or remove m bases (homopolymer deletion).
	-Could we infer n, p and m from AlignQC?
		-I don't think so, but this would be a nice way to model homopolymer. I will try to implement this.

-error_profile.detailed does not contain info about homopolymers insertion and deletions. It could be interesting to do so (not sure if AlignQC gives us this info);

-Get context specific error profile?

-Maybe it would be intereting to get the 6-mer error profile?
	-The probability of changing a 6-mer to another?
	-This is what the basecaller produces from the raw signal...
