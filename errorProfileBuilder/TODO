-generate staircase effect profile or model it using a gaussian distribution?
-error_profile.detailed is not divided between homopolymers insertion and deletion. It could be interesting to do so (not sure if AlignQC gives us this info)
-get context specific error profile
-from e-mail:
    Keep in memory the n last bases when I write a read
    if these bases are all a A or all a C and so  on, with a certain probability p I insert m additionnal bases of the same nucleotide.
    Could we infer n, p and m from AlignQC ?
